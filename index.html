        <h3>What is Chromite?</h3>
        <p>
            Chromite is a free and open source browser that is a fork of the Chromium project and is 
            designed to be secure, private, and easy to use. The project was created from the ashes of
            Bromite, another browser that was based on Chromium with a similar goal, but was sadly abandoned.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I install Chromite?</h3>
        <p>
            As of now, the way to use the browser is to download the apk file from our Github and install it.
            We are working on getting an F-Droid repository up and running, but don't have on yet. An auto update
            fuctionality is being worked on, but as of now the way to update is to download a fresh apk. For now, 
            an easy solution to be notified of updates is to get the RSS feed of our releases page on Github, or to 
            set up notifications for it so you can notified by email of new releases.
        </p>
