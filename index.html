        <h3>What is Chromite?</h3>
        <p>
            Chromite is a free and open source browser that is a fork of the Chromium project that is 
            designed to be secure, private, and easy to use. The project was created from the ashes of
            Bromite, another browser that was based on Chromium with a similar goal, but was sadly abandoned.
